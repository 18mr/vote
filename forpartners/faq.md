## Can I embed my Rock the Vote widget directly without creating a lightbox?

No, the RTV widget requires the lightbox. This is because the script is written to execute on RTV's domain. This keeps the widget functioning correctly and securely.

## Can I access my statistics via Rock the Vote?

Yes. Send a request to the 18MR Civic Engagement Fellows, and you'll get access to your latest data. 

## Will I receive the contact information of the voters I helped register?

Yes. At the close of all voter registration periods, you'll receive a list of voters who opted into updates from you to add to your email list.
