## About Our Civic Engagement

Since our founding in 2012, online civic engagement and engaging the Asian American and Pacific Islander community in electoral process has always been a high priority for us. 

### 2012

* We helped over 40 AAPI organizations use the online voter registration widget on their website. We also encouraged people to register to vote by designing memes to be shared, including [voter registration memes](https://www.facebook.com/pg/18MillionRising.org/photos/?tab=album&album_id=479486912082887){:target="_blank"} and Uncle Sam memes.
