***Access to voting is our priority. We put together this kit so you have everything you need to vote and encourage your family to go with you.** There are links to register to vote and to check your registration status. And, we provide our reasons for why Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders should vote and the issues at stake for our families and communities on Election Day.* 


## 2018 is the year that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders vote. 

For many of us, our parents and families were tasked with survival and us with self-actualization. And we have the ability to not just survive, but thrive and decide our own futures. 

**Many of our families have made immense sacrifices to support us.** Maybe they gave up everything to immigrate here, maybe they work long hours in service jobs, maybe they worry about their financial security. 

**Now it’s time we support them.** It’s time to vote for people and initiatives that will make all our lives easier. Choosing to vote is choosing our futures. 

**Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the deciding votes in close elections.** We’re 5% or more of all eligible voters in battleground states. If we all showed up on Election Day, our voting power could not be stopped. 

**Get yourself registered. Get your family registered. Let’s vote.** 

## The Issues

In this moment in history, our democracy is under attack, and your vote is critical. Asian American and Pacific Islander voters should know how candidates and ballot measures impact our communities.

**5 Issues Asian American and Pacific Islander Voters Should Know About**


**1) Immigration**


From the Trump administration’s cruel family separation policy to increased deportations and I.C.E. raids, immigration is a top issue for Asian American and Pacific Islander voters. We’ve seen [immigration raids](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-deports-cambodian-refugees_us_5b7707b9e4b05906b4135dea) on [Southeast Asian refugee](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/they-came-here-refugees-now-u-s-may-be-deporting-n872856) communities as well as detention of [South Asian asylum seekers](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/oregon-prison-asylum-detainees/index.html). 

**Measures are also being taken to limit legal paths to immigration.** One way this is happening is through Public Charge. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed [changing the definition of “public charge,”](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-super-public-charge-rule-20180928-story.html) a policy term for someone who is primarily dependent on the government. Being labeled a public charge counts against immigrants applying for residency or even entry into the United States. **The changes would allow DHS to deny a green card or begin deportation proceedings for immigrants who apply for or use public benefits, like Medicaid, SNAP and many others, even if the benefit is for their U.S. citizen kids and family members.**

**There are [current attempts](https://abc7news.com/politics/daca-program-still-in-legal-limbo-a-year-after-trump-tried-to-end-it/4355407/) to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program**, which provides some young undocumented immigrants with temporary protection from deportation and work permits. [Over 100,000 undocumented Asian immigrants qualify for DACA](http://www.insightintodiversity.com/daca-has-a-significant-impact-on-the-asian-american-community/) and their status in the U.S. is at risk so long as DACA is under attack. 

**2) Economy**

Although our [low national unemployment rate](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/03/634939540/jobs-outlook-steady-gains-low-unemployment-what-about-wages) is one sign of a strong economy, many of us continue to struggle to make ends meet. **In fact, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face the [highest level of income inequality](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-now-most-economically-divided-group-u-s-report-n890646) of any race in the U.S.**

To make things worse, a [massive tax overhaul was passed at the end of 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/15/the-final-gop-tax-bill-is-complete-heres-what-is-in-it/?utm_term=.a436341c8993), changing taxes that mostly benefit corporations and the very wealthy -- leaving working and middle class AAPIs with smaller tax breaks that expire after 2025. 


**3) Healthcare**

Quality and fair healthcare are critical to our wellness, but we continue to face barriers to accessing health coverage. 

For many of us, we’ve gained health coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Health advocates have supported the ACA (also known as Obamacare) for helping to insure more AAPIs and dropping the uninsured rate. Despite these drops, [some groups still face double-digit uninsured rates](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/health-insurance-rate-ticks-some-asian-american-groups-n802826), including Bangladeshi (12.2 percent), Pakistani (11 percent), and Thai (11 percent) Americans. 

**[Current threats to the ACA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-affordable-care-act-is-under-fire-again-in-federal-court/2018/09/05/463c48cc-b11d-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html?utm_term=.b258288f2513)** could put nearly 12 million Americans at risk of losing health benefits if the program is ended. 

**4) Education**

Attacks on affirmative action in elite universities have been a hot topic this year. The Department of Justice has even [weighed into the legal case](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/30/politics/harvard-justice-department-affirmative-action-asian-americans-lawsuit/index.html) against Harvard University, arguing that its holistic review process discriminates against Asian students. **The truth is, [most Asian Americans support affirmative action](http://aapidata.com/blog/asianam-affirmative-action-surveys/) and have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action programs.** 

**The Model Minority Myth tries to fool us into thinking that all Asian American students are getting into top schools and excelling.** The myth erases the many young people who struggle in school due to [funding cuts](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/31/teachers-demand-public-education-reform-on-the-campaign-trail.html) and lack of support for first generation, working class students, or are funneled into the [school-to-prison pipeline](https://advancingjustice-la.org/sites/default/files/18877%20AAPIs%20Behind%20Bars.pdf).

**5) Housing**

The [rising cost of housing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/us-house-prices-are-going-to-rise-at-twice-the-speed-of-inflation-and-pay-reuters-poll.html), and a shortage of affordable homes, continues to impact Asian Americans.

**Gentrification of ethnic enclaves like LA’s Little Tokyo, NYC’s Chinatown and Honolulu neighborhoods show how profits are valued over people.** We lack strong policies preventing predatory landlords and real estate developers from pushing working-class Asian immigrants and Pacific Islanders out of their homes. 

## Why We Should Vote

**Our legal right to vote as Asians living as American citizens is only 66 years old, a liberty gained after the McCarren Act in 1952.** 

Our right to vote came 70 years after the Chinese Exclusion Act -- the first law passed to keep out a specific ethnic group and barring people of Chinese ancestry from becoming U.S. citizens. The Chinese Exclusion Act inspired more laws banning people from other Asian countries, shutting down our political voice. 

In this moment in history, our democracy is under attack, and your vote is critical.**On Election Day, our collective vote as an Asian American movement signals that we won’t take these injustices anymore.** 

Your vote advocates for safe passage into the U.S. for the thousands of separated children at the border, for the refugees fleeing the bombings in Syria and Yemen, for the travellers detained at the airports from the nations on the Muslim Ban list. Your vote changes the future for all the women too afraid to speak out on sexual assault and gaslit as con-artists when they do. 

Your vote secures healthcare for the people who are sick, unable to access the fair healthcare that they deserve, because healthcare is a human right. Your vote forces corrupt politicians out of office responsible for dirty tap water laced with lead in our pipes and bodies. Your vote demands affordable housing and ending gentrification because access to safe shelter is a human right. 

Your vote welcomes Pacific Islanders fleeing their homes from the rising sea levels driven by climate change and nuclear fallout. Your vote protects Cambodian Americans unjustly targeted for deportation. Your vote is an action of solidarity with the Muslims, Sikhs, and South Asians who are scared they may be stabbed in public spaces because Islamophobia has made them targets. 

Your vote remembers our Asian American ancestors who came here as indentured servants, fieldhands, laborers, and merchants who didn’t have the right to vote. Your vote honors your parents and families who fought racism and xenophobia to survive in the U.S. and kept chasing their American dream. 

**More than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) live in the United States and we’re the fastest-growing racial group in the country.** By 2036, [we’ll be nearly 10% of all eligible voters.](http://naasurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NAAS16-post-election-report.pdf)

![](/static/images/AAPIVOTE_INFO.png) 

**We’re the deciding vote in close elections.** We’re [5% or more of the voting-eligible population](http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2018/05/07/450310/5-ways-increase-asian-american-voter-turnout/) in nine states, 79 counties and 102 congressional districts. And in battleground states like Virginia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia, we have the numbers to decide an election. 

**Since 2000, there has been a growth of over [620,000 new AAPI voters nationwide](http://www.apiavote.org/why-aapi)** for each presidential cycle. Yet, only [56% of AAPIs are registered to vote](http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2018/05/07/450310/5-ways-increase-asian-american-voter-turnout/) compared with 72% of whites. And in 2016, only 49% of eligible AAPIs turned out to vote compared to more than 64% of whites. 
We’re changing those numbers and giving you the tools to get out #OurAAPIVote.

## Building Power Together

**Non-voters are most likely to be poor, young, Asian American, Pacific Islander or Latinx.** And, [non-voters](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/645223716/on-the-sidelines-of-democracy-exploring-why-so-many-americans-dont-vote) are also more likely to support redistributing wealth, making housing affordable, and having a strong social safety net. If we want to live in a future where these initiatives are supported and our communities are heard, we’ll need to vote for people who reflect our values. 

Voting is a habit that is taught. **And if our parents, families and friends don’t typically vote, it’s up to us to teach ourselves and them.**

## Building Our Futures Together

Election Day and voter registration deadlines are coming up fast. Asian American and Pacific Islander voters can be the deciding force in the 2018 elections. If everyone of us registers our families to vote and gets them to the poll on Election Day, we have a say in who represents us and the policies that affect our communities and families. 

We made this kit because who better to empower the Asian American Pacific Islander community but ourselves. In the words of Grace Lee Boggs, “we are the leaders we’ve been looking for.” And we believe that choosing to vote, is choosing to build our futures. 

**2018 is the year Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders vote.**
