## VoterVOX: Language Assistance for Every Voter

This year, we're excited to pilot [VoterVOX](http://votervox.org), a new voter assistance tool that matches multilingual volunteers with voters who need language assistance. We're testing in **California** and **Minnesota** in 2016 and will hopefully be piloting different states in the future.

To learn more about VoterVOX, or to become a volunteer, visit us at [votervox.org](http://votervox.org).
