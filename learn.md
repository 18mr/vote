## WHY #OurAAPIVote?

For many AAPIs, our families were tasked with immigrant survival and bootstrap tenacity. Maybe they gave up everything to immigrate here, maybe they work long hours in service jobs, maybe they worry about their financial security. 

**Now it’s time we support them.**  It’s time to vote for people and initiatives that will make all our lives easier. Our vote for the AAPI community will help support  a future that supports our families.

## Why Should AAPIs Vote?

***This is one of the hardest conversations to have with community members - trying to find reasons to encourage them to vote that resonates. We’ve come up a list of talking points that we hope you will be able to use when encouraging people to vote.*** 

* [Our legal right to vote as Asians living as American citizens is only 66 years old, a liberty gained after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1952)

* The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first law passed to keep out a specific ethnic group and barring people of Chinese ancestry from becoming U.S. citizens. The Chinese Exclusion Act inspired more laws banning people from other Asian countries, shutting down our political voice. And it kept Asians from being able to participate in the electoral process.

* **More than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) live in the United States and we’re the fastest-growing racial group in the country.** By 2036, [we’ll be nearly 10% of all eligible voters.](http://naasurvey.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NAAS16-post-election-report.pdf)


* **Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the deciding votes in close elections.** We’re [5% or more of the voting-eligible population](http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2018/05/07/450310/5-ways-increase-asian-american-voter-turnout/) in nine states, 79 counties and 102 congressional districts. And in battleground states like Virginia, Nevada, North Carolina, and Georgia, we have the numbers to decide an election. 

* **Since 2000, there has been a growth of over [620,000 new AAPI voters nationwide](http://www.apiavote.org/why-aapi)** for each presidential cycle. Yet, only [56% of AAPIs are registered to vote](http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2018/05/07/450310/5-ways-increase-asian-american-voter-turnout/) compared with 72% of whites. And in 2016, only 49% of eligible AAPIs turned out to vote compared to more than 64% of whites.

***Commiting to vote is the first step to the getting engaged in the electoral process. It is for this reason we’ve created our Pledge to Vote tool to help get your community to turn out to vote. We’ve included some social media messaging you can use to ask people to sign the pledge:***

## How Do I Register to Vote? 

**There are a lot of people that don’t know that to register to vote takes an extra step!**

Registering to vote is easy - if you are a U.S. citizen, 18 years old by Election Day, and meet your state’s requirements, you have the right to vote. Every state except North Dakota requires you to register to vote and every state has an absentee voting process. 

**Registering to vote is a simple process - you can  register to vote through an online link right [here.](http://bit.ly/18MR_register)**

* Make sure you register before the deadline in your state, which is often 30 or 15 days before Election Day. Check voter registration deadlines [here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)

If you think you’re already registered, you can check your registration status [here](http://bit.ly/18MR_voterstatus). 

If you can’t go to the polls on Election Day, [you can sign up for an Absentee ballot where your ballot will be sent to your mailbox, which you can do here.](http://bit.ly/18MR_absentee)
