Have your widget all set up? It's time to spread the word to let people know they can register to vote online through your website! Here are a couple tools you can use to get started.

## Send Out A Press Release

Generate a PDF using our [press release template]({{ baseurl }}/partners/pressrelease/).

Make sure you change all the [BRACKETED] text to reflect your organization name, your contact information, and your location before you download!

## Share on Social Media

Use our social media toolkit to get your Facebook & Twitter audience to come to your site, register to vote, and share with their friends.
