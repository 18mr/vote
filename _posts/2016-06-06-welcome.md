# Midterms 2018

### LET’S GET READY TO HIT THE POLLS: WE’RE GOING TO MAKE IT EASY!

## ARE YOU READY TO MAKE OUR VOTES COUNT?

This is a critical year year for your AAPI vote. Our state and local governments make a world of difference on all kinds of issues, from immigration enforcement to affordable housing. Elected officials and their appointees in states like Hawaii and Washington are at the forefront of challenging policies that harm our communities like the Muslim Ban and DACA. And, it's a big midterm year that will influence the way our whole country addresses critical issues that affect Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.

Our votes aren’t just about courting the favor of elected officials, but about building the power we need to create change in our communities, elevate our stories, and advocate for ourselves on issues that impact us.

In order to continue building that power, we have to make sure that as many AAPIs as possible are registered and able to raise their voices and vote. Access is our priority in 2018: from registration to making vote-by-mail easier than ever, we’re continuing the vision we started with five years ago.

We’re putting the power of the vote in the hands of AAPI communities across the country. The stakes have never been higher, and we’re looking forward to an exciting year!
