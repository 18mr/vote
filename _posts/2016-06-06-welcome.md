# November 8, 2016

### It's closer than you think. Get ready to get to the polls: we're going to make it easy!

## ARE YOU READY TO MAKE OUR VOTES COUNT?

Never before have AAPI votes mattered as much as they do now. In 2012, AAPIs played key roles in critical states like Nevada and South Carolina â€“ so much so that politicians have spent months courting our vote in advance of midterm and general elections. More important than making AAPIs politically attractive to electeds, our votes are about building the power we need to create change in our communities, elevate our stories, and advocate for ourselves on issues that impact us.

In order to continue building power, we have to make sure that as many AAPIs as possible are registered and able to raise their voices and vote. We're making access our top priority in 2016: from registration, to making vote by mail easier than ever, to piloting VoterVOX, we're taking our work to the next level this year.

We're putting the power of the vote in the hands of AAPI communities across the country. The stakes have never been higher, and we're looking forward to an exciting year.
