18MR staff will contact you soon with all the information you need to make it live, including logo customizations and a variety of options to embed the tool in your website.

Here's a step-by-step guide to how to set up your widget on your website.

1. __Copy the entire embed code for your widget__. The embed code will come to you in an email from 18MR staff.
2. __Paste it in the location on your website that you want to link to your widget__. The default width for the widget link is 620 pixels, so placing it in a sidebar will require a little tweaking. Let 18MR staff know if you want to place it elsewhere.
3. __Save your page, and test it out__. You should be able to click the logo and a lightbox will open that contains the voter registration tool.

It's that simple! If you run into any trouble, check out the FAQ or get in touch.
